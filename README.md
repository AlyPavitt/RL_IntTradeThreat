# Likelihood of species threat from international trade
Categorises species as either ‘likely’ (L) or ‘unlikely’ (U) to be threatened by international trade, or as having insufficient information to determine the likelihood of this threat (I) based on the species’ global IUCN Red List assessment.

# Methods
These methods apply a systematic and automated approach to the decision tree developed and published in [Challender *et al.* 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02115-8) to categorise the likelihood of a species being threatened by international trade. The approach is a substantive advancement on the initial proof of concept script tested in Challender *et al.* on two test classes (Amphibia and Actinopterygii), and is applicable to all animals, plants and fungi with IUCN Red List assessments. 

The process is structured into three scripts and a 'library' of keywords that are combined to search the free text fields of the Red List assessments. Methods and validation are summarised in [methods](https://github.com/AlyPavitt/RL_IntTradeThreat/blob/5207adb03f92d74fc2a5dbfcb23d298f4b0d45f5/Methods).
